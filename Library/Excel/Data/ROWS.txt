Summary






The Excel ROWS function returns the count of rows in a given reference. For example, ROWS(A1:A3) returns 3, since the range A1:A3 contains 3 rows.


















Purpose 

Get the number of rows in an array or reference.



Return value 

Number of rows



Arguments 

array - A reference to a cell or range of cells.



Syntax 

=ROWS(array)



Usage notes 

The ROWS function returns the count of rows in a given reference as a number. For example, =ROWS(A1:A5) returns 5, since the range A1:A5 contains 5 rows. ROWS takes just one argument, called array, which can be a range or array.
Examples
Use the ROWS function to get the row count for a given reference or range. For example, there are 10 rows in the range A1:F10 so the formula below returns 10:

=ROWS(A1:F10) // returns 10

The range A1:Z100 contains 100 rows, so the formula below returns 100: 

=ROWS(A1:Z100) // returns 100

You can also use the ROWS function to get a row count for an array constant:

=ROWS({1;2;3;4;5}) // returns 5

Although there is no built-in function to count the number of cells in a range, you can use the ROWS function together with the COLUMNS function like this:

=COLUMNS(range)*ROWS(range) // total cells
=COLUMNS(A1:Z100)*ROWS(A1:Z100) // returns 2600

More details here.
Notes

Array can be a range or a reference to a single contiguous group of cells.
Array can be an array constant or an array created by another formula.
To count columns, see the COLUMNS function.
To get row numbers, see the ROW function.
To lookup a row number, see the MATCH function.
