STDEV.S Function

Summary
The Excel STDEV.S function calculates the standard deviation for a sample set of data. STDEV.S replaces the older STDEV function, with the same behavior.
Purpose 
Get the standard deviation in a sample
Return value 
Estimated standard deviation
Arguments 
number1 - First number or reference in the sample.number2 - [optional] Second number or reference.
Syntax 
=STDEV.S(number1, [number2], ...)
Usage notes 
The STDEV.S function calculates the standard deviation in a sample set of data. Standard deviation is a measure of how much variance there is in a set of numbers compared to the average (mean) of the numbers. The STDEV.S function is meant to estimate standard deviation in a sample. If data represents an entire population, use the STDEV.P function.
Note: STDEV.S replaces the older STDEV function, but has identical behavior. Although STDEV still exists for backwards compatibility, Microsoft recommends that people use the newer STDEV.S function instead.

Notes:
STDEV.S calculates standard deviation using the "n-1" method.
STDEV.S assumes data is a sample only. When data represents an  entire population, use the STDEV.P function.
Numbers are supplied as arguments. They can be supplied as actual numbers, ranges, arrays, or references that contain numbers.
STDEV.S ignores empty cells, logical values, and text that appears in supplied reference(s).
STDEV.S will evaluate text and logical values hardcoded as function arguments.
To evaluate logical values and/or numbers as text in a reference, see the STDEVA function.
