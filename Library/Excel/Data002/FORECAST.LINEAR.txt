Summary
The Excel FORECAST function predicts a value based on existing values along a linear trend. FORECAST calculates future value predictions using linear regression, and can be used to predict numeric values like sales, inventory, expenses, measurements, etc.
Note: Starting with Excel 2016, the FORECAST function was replaced with the FORECAST.LINEAR function. Microsoft recommends replacing FORECAST with FORECAST.LINEAR, since FORECAST will eventually be deprecated.
