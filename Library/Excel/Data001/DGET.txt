Summary
The Excel DGET function gets a single value in a given field from a record that matches criteria. DGET will throw the #NUM error if more than one record matches criteria.
Purpose 
Get value from matching record
Return value 
The value in a given field
Arguments 
database - Database range including headers.field - Field name or index to count.criteria - Criteria range including headers.
Syntax 
=DGET(database, field, criteria)
Usage notes 
The Excel DGET function gets a single value from a given field in a record that matches criteria. The database argument is a range of cells that includes field headers, field is the name or index of the field to get a max value from, and criteria is a range of cells with headers that match those in database. 
Using the example above, you can get the value from the field "Total" in a record where color is "Red" and "Day" is Tue with either of the two formulas below:
=DGET(B7:E14,"Total",B4:E5) // field by name
=DGET(B7:E14,4,B4:E5) // field by index
The DGET function is designed to extract a single value based on matching criteria. When more than one record matches criteria, DGET will throw the #NUM error.
Criteria options
The criteria can include a variety of expressions, including some wildcards. The table below shows some examples:
Criteria
Behavior
Red
Match "red" or "RED"
Re*
Begins with "re"
10
Equal to 10
>10
Greater than 10
<>
Not blank
<>100
Not 100
>12/19/2017
Greater than Dec 19, 2017
Note: it appears support for wildcards is not as extensive as with other functions like COUNTIFS, SUMIFS, MATCH etc. For example, the pattern ??? will match strings with 3 exactly characters in more modern functions, but not in the database functions. If you are using wildcards, test carefully.
Multi-row criteria
The criteria range for DGET can include more than one row below the headers. When criteria includes more than one row, each row is joined with OR logic, and the expressions in a given criteria row are joined with AND logic.
Notes:
DGET will throw the #NUM error if more than one record matches criteria.
DGET supports wildcards in criteria
Criteria can include more than one row
The field argument can be supplied as a name in double quotes ("") or as a number representing field index.
The database and criteria ranges must include matching headers.
