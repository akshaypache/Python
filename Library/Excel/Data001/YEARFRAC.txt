Summary
The Excel YEARFRAC function returns a decimal value that represents fractional years between two dates. You can use YEARFRAC to do things like calculate age with a birthdate.
Purpose 
Get the fraction of a year between two dates
Return value 
A decimal number
Arguments 
start_date - The start date.end_date - The end date.basis - [optional] The type of day count basis to use (see below).
Syntax 
=YEARFRAC(start_date, end_date, [basis])
Usage notes 
YEARFRAC calculates a decimal number representing the fraction of a year between two dates. Excel uses whole days between two dates to work out the fraction of a year as a decimal value. For example:
=YEARFRAC("1-Jan-2018","1-Jan-2019") // returns 1
=YEARFRAC("1-Jan-2018","1-Jul-2019") // returns 1.5
The YEARFRAC function has an optional argument called "basis" that controls how days are counted when computing fractional years. The default behavior is to count days between two dates based on a 360-day year, where all 12 months are considered to have 30 days. The table below summarizes available options:
Basis
Calculation
Notes
0 (default)
30/360
US convention
1
actual/actual
 
2
actual/360
 
3
actual/365
 
4
30/360
European convention
Note that basis 0 (the default) and basis 4 both operate based on a 360 day year, but they handle the last day of the month differently. With the US convention, when the start date is the last day of the month, it is set to the 30th day of the same month. When the end date is the last day of the month, and the start date < 30, the end date is set to the 1st of the next month, otherwise the end date is set to the 30th of the same month.
With the European convention, start dates and end dates equal to the 31st of a month are set to the 30th of the same month.
Examples
With a start date in A1, and an end date in B1, the YEARFRAC will return years between to two dates as a fractional number:
=YEARFRAC(A1,B1) // years between two dates 
To get a whole number only (not rounded), you can use the INT function like this:
=INT(YEARFRAC(A1,B1)) // whole number only, discard decimal
To get current age based on a birthdate, you can use a formula like this:
=INT(YEARFRAC(birthdate,TODAY())) // age from birthdate
Note: this formula can sometimes return incorrect results. See this example for more details.
To get the percentage of the current year complete, you can use YEARFRAC like this:
=YEARFRAC(DATE(YEAR(TODAY()),1,1),TODAY()) // % year complete
