Summary
The Excel NORM.INV function returns the inverse of the normal cumulative distribution for the specified mean and standard deviation. Given the probability of an event occurring below a threshold value, the function returns the threshold value associated with the probability.
Purpose 
Get the inverse of normal cumulative distribution
Return value 
The threshold value associated with a probability
Arguments 
probability - The probability of an event occurring below a threshold.mean - The mean of the distribution.standard_dev - The standard deviation of the distribution.
Syntax 
=NORM.INV(probability, mean, standard_dev)
