Summary






The Excel ENCODEURL function returns a URL-encoded string composed of US-ASCII characters. ENCODEURL is only available in Excel 2013 and later on Windows.


















Purpose 

Get URL-encoded string



Return value 

Encoded text



Arguments 

text - The text to be encoded.



Syntax 

=ENCODEURL(text)



Usage notes 

The ENCODEURL function returns a URL-encoded string composed of US-ASCII characters. URL encoding, sometimes called "percent encoding" is a method of encoding characters in a URL using only legal US-ASCII characters. Some characters cannot be part of a URL and are "reserved". Only characters that are  reserved are encoded by ENCODEURL; other characters are left untouched. Common reserved characters include the space character (" "), the forward slash "/", the hash character (#) and others as shown in the example above.
Example
To use ENCODEURL, supply text or a cell reference that contains text. In the example below, ENCODEURL is used to encode the text "Hello World!"

=ENCODEURL("Hello World!") // returns "Hello%20World%21"

In the example at the top of the page, the formula in cell C5, copied down is:

=ENCODEURL(B5)

At each new row, ENCODEURL returns the encoded text from column B. 
Reserved characters
The table below shows a list of reserved characters and their url-encoded equivalent.
