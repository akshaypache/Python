Summary






The Excel LEN function returns the length of a given text string as the number of characters. LEN will also count characters in numbers, but number formatting is not included.


















Purpose 

Get the length of text.



Return value 

Number of characters



Arguments 

text - The text for which to calculate length.



Syntax 

=LEN(text)



Usage notes 

The LEN function returns the number of characters in a given text string. LEN takes just one argument, text. LEN counts the number of characters in text, including space and punctuation, and returns a number as the result. If text is an empty string ("") or text is a reference to an empty cell, LEN returns zero. LEN will also count characters in numbers, but number formatting is not included.
Examples
LEN returns the count of characters in a text string:

=LEN("apple") // returns 5

Space characters are included in the count:

=LEN("apple ") // returns 6

LEN also works with numeric values, but number formatting is not included:

=LEN(1000) // returns 4
=LEN($1,000) // returns 4

The LEN function often appears in other formulas that manipulate text in some way. For example, it can be used with the RIGHT and FIND functions to extract text to the right of a given character:

=RIGHT(A1,LEN(A1)-FIND(char,A1)) // get text to right of char

FIND returns the position of the character, which is subtracted from length, calculated with LEN. RIGHT returns the text to the right of that position.  Full explanation here.
Notes

LEN returns the length of text as a number.
LEN works with numbers, but number formatting is not included.
LEN returns zero if a value is empty.
