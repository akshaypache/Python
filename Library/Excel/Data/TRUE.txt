TRUE Function
Related functions 

FALSE
IF























Summary






The Excel TRUE function returns the Boolean value TRUE. The TRUE function is classified as a "compatibility function", needed only for compatibility with other spreadsheet applications. There is no need to use TRUE() if you are creating a spreadsheet in Excel.


















Purpose 

Generate the logical value TRUE



Return value 

The logical value TRUE



Arguments 





Syntax 

=TRUE()



Usage notes 

The TRUE function returns the Boolean value TRUE. In other words, the two formulas below based on the IF function are functionally equivalent:

=IF(A1>65,TRUE())
=IF(A1>65,TRUE)

Both formulas return TRUE if the value in A1 is greater than 65.
The TRUE function is provided for compatibility with other spreadsheet applications and there is no need to use it if you are creating a spreadsheet in Excel. To return TRUE as a result in a formula, just enter TRUE directly into a cell or formula. 
Note that logical expressions will automatically generate TRUE and FALSE results. For example, the formula below will TRUE or FALSE:

=A1>90

To test a condition and return different results based on whether the results are TRUE or FALSE, see the examples on this page.
