# variables declare rules
# 1) we cant start variable name with numbers
# ex: 123ade, 3jf,5frdj,4jf4,34fd
# 2) we can use underscore(_) in variable name
# ex: city_name, full_name, _name,
# 3) we can use numbers, letters and underscore
# ex: a1, a_1, a43654,abc2,
# 4) varable names are case sensetive
# ex:
# name = "sachin"
# Name = "chaitra"
# NAME = "shivani"
# Print(NAME)

# name = "chaitra"
# NAME = "ankit"
# Name = "salman"
