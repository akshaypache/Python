Summary
The Excel AVERAGEA function returns the average of a set of supplied values. Unlike AVERAGE, AVERAGEA will also evaluate the logical values TRUE and FALSE, and numbers represented as text, whereas AVERAGE ignores these values during calculation
Purpose 
Get the average of a group of numbers and text
Return value 
A number representing the average.
Arguments 
value1 - A value or reference to a value that can be evaluated as a number.value2 - [optional] A value or reference to a value that can be evaluated as a number.
Syntax 
=AVERAGEA(value1, [value2], ...)
Usage notes 
The AVERAGEA function returns the average of a set of supplied values. AVERAGEA will include the logical values TRUE and FALSE, and numbers represented as text in the calculation. The AVERAGE function ignores these values during calculation
AVERAGEA takes multiple arguments in the form of value1, value2, value3, etc. up to 255 total. Arguments can include numbers, cell references, ranges, arrays, and constants. Empty cells are ignored, but zero (0) values are included. 
Examples
To average values in the range A1:A10, including logical the logical values TRUE (1) and FALSE (0) and numbers entered as text, use AVERAGEA like this:
=AVERAGEA(A1:A10) // average numbers, logicals, numbers as text
One confusing aspect of the AVERAGE function compared to the AVERAGEA function is that both functions will evaluate logicals and numbers entered as text when they are hardcoded as constants in a formula:
=AVERAGE(TRUE,2) // returns 1.5
=AVERAGEA(TRUE,2) // returns 1.5
=AVERAGE("3",2) // returns 2.5
=AVERAGEA("3",2) // returns 2.5
However, the AVERAGE function will ignore logicals or numbers entered as text when they appear in cell references. You can see this behavior in the worksheet example shown above.
Notes
Values can be supplied as numbers, ranges, named ranges, or cell references that contain values. Up to 255 arguments can be supplied.
To calculate the average, Excel adds the numeric value of each value together and divides by the total number of values supplied.
AVERAGEA evaluates TRUE as 1 and FALSE as zero.
