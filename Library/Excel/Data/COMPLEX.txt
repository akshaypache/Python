Summary






The Excel COMPLEX function creates a complex number with given real and imaginary coefficients. COMPLEX returns a text result in the form x + yi or x + yj.


















Purpose 

Convert coefficients to complex number



Return value 

Complex number as text



Arguments 

real_num - The real number.i_num - The imaginary number.suffix - [optional] The suffix, either "i" or "j".



Syntax 

=COMPLEX(real_num, i_num, [suffix])



Usage notes 

A complex number has two parts: a real number and an imaginary number. The COMPLEX function converts real and imaginary coefficients into a complex number of the form x + yi or x + yj, where x represents the real number and y represents the imaginary number. For example:

=COMPLEX(5,3) // returns 5+3i

To use the "j" instead of "i":

=COMPLEX(5,3,"j") // returns 5+3j

In the example shown, the formula in E6 is:

=COMPLEX(B6,C6)

Notes:

If omitted, suffix defaults to "i".
suffix must be lowercase "i" or "j"; other values result in a #VALUE error.
If real_num or i_num are nonnumeric, COMPLEX returns the #VALUE! error.
