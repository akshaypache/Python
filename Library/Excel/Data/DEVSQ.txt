Summary






The Excel DEVSQ function returns the sum of the squared deviations from the mean for a given set of data. 


















Purpose 

Get sum of squared deviations



Return value 

Calculated sum



Arguments 

number1 - First value or reference.number2 - [optional] Second value or reference.



Syntax 

=DEVSQ(number1, [number2], ...)



Usage notes 

The Excel DEVSQ function calculates the sum of the squared deviations from the mean for a given set of data. Variance and standard deviation functions deal with negative deviations by squaring deviations before they are averaged. DEVSQ calculates the sum of the squared deviations from the mean, without dividing by N or by N-1.
The DEVSQ function takes multiple arguments in the form number1, number2, number3, etc. up to 255 total. Arguments can be a hardcoded constant, a cell reference, or a range. A single range or array can be provided instead of multiple arguments.
Examples
In the example shown, the formula in G5 is:

=DEVSQ(B5:B10)

The formulas in C5 and D5 are, respectively:

=B5-$G$4 // deviation
=C5^2 // squared deviation

The value in D12 (34) is simply the sum of D5:D10, and agrees with the value calculated directly by DEVSQ in G5.
Notes

Arguments can be numbers, names, arrays, or references that contain numbers.
Empty cells, and cells that contain text or logical values are ignored.
