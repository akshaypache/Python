DVARP
Summary
The Excel DVAR function returns the variance of a sample extracted from records that match the given criteria. If data represents the entire population, use the DVARP function.
Purpose 
Get sample variance for matching records
Return value 
The calculated variance
Arguments 
database - Database range including headers.field - Field name or index to count.criteria - Criteria range including headers.
Syntax 
=DVAR(database, field, criteria)
Usage notes 
The Excel DVAR function gets the variance of a sample extracted from records matching criteria, using values in a given field.
The database argument is a range of cells that includes field headers, field is the name or index of the field to get a max value from, and criteria is a range of cells with headers that match those in database. 
Using the example above, you can get the variance of heights for the group "Fox" with either of these formulas:
=DVAR(B7:C13,"Height",B4:C5) // field by name
=DVAR(B7:C13,2,B4:C5) // field by index
Criteria options
The criteria can include a variety of expressions, including some wildcards. The table below shows some examples:
Criteria
Behavior
Red
Match "red" or "RED"
Re*
Begins with "re"
10
Equal to 10
>10
Greater than 10
<>
Not blank
<>100
Not 100
>12/19/2017
Greater than Dec 19, 2017
Note: Support for wildcards is not quite the same as with other functions like COUNTIFS, SUMIFS, MATCH, etc. For example, the pattern ??? will match strings with 3 exactly characters in more modern functions, but not in the database functions. If you are using wildcards, test carefully.
Multi-row criteria
The criteria range for DVAR can include more than one row below the headers. When criteria includes more than one row, each row is joined with OR logic, and the expressions in a given criteria row are joined with AND logic.
Notes:
DVAR is the mean to calculate variance for a sample. If data represents the entire population, use the DVARP function.
DVAR supports some wildcards in criteria
Criteria can include more than one row (as explained above)
The field argument can be supplied as a name in double quotes ("") or as a number representing field index.
The database and criteria ranges must include matching headers.
