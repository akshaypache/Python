QUOTIENT























Summary






The Excel MOD function returns the remainder of two numbers after division.  For example, MOD(10,3) = 1. The result of MOD carries the same sign as the divisor.


















Purpose 

Get the remainder from division



Return value 

The remainder



Arguments 

number - The number to be divided.divisor - The number to divide with.



Syntax 

=MOD(number, divisor)



Usage notes 

The MOD function returns the remainder after division.  For example, MOD(3,2) returns 1, because 2 goes into 3 once, with a remainder of 1. 
The MOD function takes two arguments: number and divisor. Number is the number to be divided, and divisor is the number used to divide. Both arguments are required. If either argument is not numeric, the MOD function returns #VALUE!.
Equation
The result from the MOD function is calculated with an equation like this:

=n-d*INT(n/d)

where n is number, d is divisor, and INT is the INT function. This can create some unexpected results because of the way that the INT function rounds negative numbers down, way from zero:

=MOD(7,3) // returns 1
=MOD(7,-3) // returns -2

MOD with negative numbers is implemented differently in different languages.
Examples
Below are some examples of the MOD function with hardcoded values:

=MOD(12,3) // returns 0
=MOD(12,5) // returns 2
=MOD(100,33) // returns 1
=MOD(6.25,1) // returns 0.25

Negative numbers
The result from MOD carries the same sign as divisor. If divisor is positive, the result from MOD is positive, if divisor is negative, the result from MOD is negative:

=MOD(-3,2) // returns 1
=MOD(3,-2) // returns -1
=MOD(-3,-2) // returns -1

Time from datetime
The MOD function can be used to extract the time value from an Excel date that includes time (sometimes called a datetime). With a datetime in A1, the formula below returns the time only:

=MOD(A1,1) // return time only

Detailed explanation here.
Large numbers
With very large numbers, you may see the MOD function return a #NUM error. In that case, you can try an alternative version based on the INT function:

=number-(INT(number/divisor)*divisor)

Notes

MOD is often seen in formulas that deal with "every nth" value
MOD is useful for extracting the time from a date
MOD always returns a result in the same sign as the divisor.
MOD will return a #DIV/0! error if divisor is zero
To discard the remainder and keep the integer, see the QUOTIENT function.
