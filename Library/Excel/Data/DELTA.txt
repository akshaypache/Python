DELTA Function 




















Summary






The Excel DELTA function will test if two numeric values are equal. When values are equal, DELTA returns 1, otherwise, DELTA returns zero.


















Purpose 

Test two values are equal



Return value 

The number one or zero



Arguments 

number1 - The first number.number2 - [optional] The second number.



Syntax 

=DELTA(number1, [number2])



Usage notes 

The DELTA function tests two numeric values for equality. When values are equal, DELTA returns 1. When values are different, DELTA returns zero. As a result, DELTA can be used to easily count pairs of equal numbers.
For example:

=DELTA(5,4) // returns 0
=DELTA(3,3) // returns 1

In the example shown, the formula in D6, copied down, is:

=DELTA(B6,C6)

Notes:

If number2 is left blank, DELTA assumes number2 equals zero
If either value is text, DELTA returns the #VALUE error.
