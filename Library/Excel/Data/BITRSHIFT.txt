BITLSHIFT























Summary






The Excel BITRSHIFT function shifts a number by the specified number of bits, effectively halving or doubling the number a specified number of times.

















Purpose 

Returns a number shifted right by some number of bits



Return value 

Decimal Number



Arguments 

number - The number to be bit shifted.shift_amount - The amount of bits to shift to the right, if negative shifts bits to the left instead.



Syntax 

=BITRSHIFT(number, shift_amount)



Usage notes 

Integer underflow results in loss of the least significant bits. For example, if the number 3 is shifted right by one, then the right-most binary bit is truncated and lost. For any bit shift that results in integer overflow, where the result is larger than 2^48 -1, the function returns the #NUM! error.
How It Works
The shift_amount can either be positive or negative. If a negative number is provided, the bits are shifted to the left instead.
