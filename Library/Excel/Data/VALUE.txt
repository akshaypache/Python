Summary






The Excel VALUE function converts text that appears in a recognized format (i.e. a number, date, or time format) into a numeric value. Normally, the VALUE function is not needed in Excel, because Excel automatically converts text to numeric values.


















Purpose 

Convert text to a number



Return value 

A numeric value.



Arguments 

text - The text value to convert to a number.



Syntax 

=VALUE(text)



Usage notes 

The VALUE function is meant to convert a text value that represents a number into a numeric value. The text can be a date, a time, or any other number, so long as the format can be recognized by Excel. When the conversion is successful, the result is a numeric value with no number formatting. When the VALUE function is unable to convert a text value to a numeric result, the result is a #VALUE! error.

=VALUE("July 15, 2021") // returns 44392
=VALUE("$125.50") // returns 125.5
=VALUE("32.5%") // returns 0.325

In general, there is no need to use the VALUE function because Excel automatically converts text to numbers as needed. However, VALUE is provided for compatibility with other spreadsheet applications.
