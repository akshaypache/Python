Summary
The Excel AND function is a logical function used to require more than one condition at the same time. AND returns either TRUE or FALSE. To test if a number in A1 is greater than zero and less than 10, use =AND(A1>0,A1<10). The AND function can be used as the logical test inside the IF function to avoid extra nested IFs, and can be combined with the OR function.
