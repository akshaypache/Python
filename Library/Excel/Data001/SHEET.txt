SHEETS
Summary
The Excel SHEET function returns the index number of a sheet in Excel. SHEET will report the sheet number for a cell reference, named range, or Excel Table.
Purpose 
Get sheet index number
Return value 
The index number of a given sheet
Arguments 
value - [optional] The value to check.
Syntax 
=SHEET([value])
Usage notes 
The SHEET function returns the index number of a sheet in Excel. You can use the SHEET function to get a numeric index that represents the order of sheets in an Excel workbook, starting with 1 on the left and ending with N on the right, where N is the total number of sheets in the workbook. The SHEET function includes hidden sheets in the numbering sequence.
The SHEET function takes one argument, value, which should be a reference, a named range, or an Excel Table. Value is optional. When value is omitted, SHEET will return a numeric index for the current sheet (i.e. the sheet the formula exists in).
Examples
For example, in a workbook with Sheet1, Sheet2, and Sheet3 running left to right:
=SHEET(Sheet1!A1) // returns 1
=SHEET(Sheet2!A1) // returns 2
=SHEET(Sheet3!A1) // returns 3
If Sheet2 is dragged all the way to the left, a reference to A1 on Sheet2 will return 1:
=SHEET(Sheet2!A1) // returns 1
SHEET can report the sheet number for a cell reference, named range, or Excel Table. For example, if a table called "Table1" exists on the third sheet in a workbook the SHEET function will return 3:
=SHEET(Table1) // returns 3
Notes
If the value argument is omitted, SHEET will return the index of the current sheet.
SHEET includes hidden sheets in the numbering sequence.
SHEET reports the index of a sheet. The SHEETS function reports the number of sheets.
