Summary
The Excel BITLSHIFT function shifts a number by the specified number of bits, effectively doubling or halving the number a specified number of times.
Purpose 
Returns a number shifted left by some number of bits
Return value 
Decimal Number
Arguments 
number - The number to be bit shifted.shift_amount - The amount of bits to shift, if negative shifts bits to the right instead.
Syntax 
=BITLSHIFT(number, shift_amount)
Usage notes 
For any bit shift that results in integer overflow, where the result is larger than 2^48 -1, the function returns the #NUM! error. 
How It Works
The shift_amount can either be positive or negative. If a negative number is provided, the bits are shifted to the right instead.
