STDEVA Function
Related functions 

STDEV.S
STDEVP
STDEV.P























Summary






The Excel STDEVA function calculates standard deviation for a sample of data. Unlike the STDEV function, STDEVA will evaluate text and logicals that appear in references. To calculate standard deviation for an entire population, use STDEVPA or STDEV.P.


















Purpose 

Get standard deviation in a sample



Return value 

Estimated standard deviation



Arguments 

number1 - First number or reference in the sample.number2 - [optional] Second number or reference.



Syntax 

=STDEVA(number1, [number2], ...)



Usage notes 

The STDEVA function calculates the standard deviation for a sample set of data, evaluating text and logicals as numbers as part of the calculation. TEXT is evaluated as zero, TRUE is evaluated as 1, and FALSE is evaluated as zero.
Standard deviation is a measure of how much variance there is in a set of numbers compared to the average (mean) of the numbers. The STDEVA function is meant to estimate standard deviation in a sample. If data represents an entire population, use the STDEVPA function.
In the example shown, the formula in E5 is:

=STDEVA(B5:B11)

Notes

Only use STDEVA when you need to evaluate logicals or text in the standard deviation calculation.
STDEVA calculates standard deviation using the "n-1" method.
STDEVA assumes data is a sample. If data representations an entire population, use STDEVP or STDEV.P.
Values are supplied as arguments. They can be supplied as actual numbers, ranges, arrays, or references that contain numbers.
STDEVA evaluates logical values and/or numbers in supplied references. To ignore these values use STDEV or STDEV.S
