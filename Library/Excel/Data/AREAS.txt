AREAS Function 




















Summary






The Excel AREAS function returns the number of areas in a given reference. For example, =AREAS((A1:C1,A2:C2)) returns 2. Multiple references must be enclosed in an extra set of parentheses.


















Purpose 

Get the number of areas in a reference.



Return value 

A number representing number of areas.



Arguments 

reference - Reference(s) to a cell or range of cells.



Syntax 

=AREAS(reference)



Usage notes 

The AREAS function returns the number of areas in a given reference as a number. In this context, areas mean separate contiguous ranges. AREAS takes just one argument, called reference. Reference can include more than one reference, but you must separate multiple references with a comma and wrap them in an extra set of parentheses. Otherwise, Excel will think the commas indicate multiple arguments and generate an error about entering too many arguments.
Examples
The formulas below show how the AREAS function can be configured. Notice the first example does not need an extra set of parentheses, since there is just one reference). However, the examples following do need the extra set of parentheses.

=AREAS(A1:C1) // returns 1
=AREAS((A1:C1,A2:C2)) // returns 2
=AREAS((F17:F19,J16:J18,I8)) // returns 3
