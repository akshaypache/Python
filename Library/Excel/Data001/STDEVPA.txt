STDEVPA Function

Summary
The Excel STDEVPA function calculates the standard deviation for an entire population. Unlike the STDEVP function, STDEVPA evaluates text and logicals that appear in references. To calculate standard deviation for a sample, use STDEVA or STDEV.S.
Purpose 
Get standard deviation for a population
Return value 
Calculated standard deviation
Arguments 
number1 - First number or reference in the sample.number2 - [optional] Second number or reference.
Syntax 
=STDEVPA(number1, [number2], ...)
Usage notes 
The STDEVPA function calculates the standard deviation for data that represents an entire population, evaluating text and logicals as numbers as part of the calculation. TEXT is evaluated as zero, TRUE is evaluated as 1, and FALSE is evaluated as zero.
Standard deviation is a measure of how much variance there is in a set of numbers compared to the average (mean) of the numbers. The STDEVPA function is meant to estimate standard deviation for an entire population. If data represents a sample, use the STDEVA function.
In the example shown, the formula in E5 is:
=STDEVPA(B5:B11)

Notes:
Only use STDEVPA when you need to evaluate logicals or text in the standard deviation calculation.
STDEVPA calculates standard deviation using the "n" method.
STDEVA assumes data is an entire population. When data representations a sample, use STDEVA or STDEV.S
Numbers are supplied as arguments. They can be supplied as actual numbers, ranges, arrays, or references that contain numbers.
STDEVPA will evaluate logical values and/or numbers in supplied references. To ignore these values use STDEVP or STDEV.P
