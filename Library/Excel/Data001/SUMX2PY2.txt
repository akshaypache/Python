Summary
The Excel SUMX2PY2 function returns the sum of the sum of squares of corresponding values in two arrays. Values can be supplied as constants, cell references, or ranges.
Purpose 
Get sum of squares in two arrays
Return value 
Calculated sum of sum of squares
Arguments 
array_x - The first range or array containing numeric values.array_y - The second range or array containing numeric values.
Syntax 
=SUMX2PY2(array_x, array_y)
Usage notes 
The SUMX2PY2 function returns the sum of the sum of squares of corresponding values in two arrays. The "p" in the function name stands for "plus", as in "sum x2 plus y2". 
SUMX2PY2 takes two arguments, array_x and array_y. Array_x is the first range or array or range of numbers, and array_y is the second range or array of numbers. Both arguments can be provided as an array constant or as a range.
Examples
=SUMX2PY2({1,2},{1,2}) // returns 10
=SUMX2PY2({1,2,3},{1,2,3}) // returns 28
In the example shown above, the formula in E5 is:
=SUMX2PY2(B5:B12,C5:C12)
which returns 600 as a result.
Equation
The equation used to calculate the sum of the sum of squares is:
 
This formula can be created manually in Excel with the exponentiation operator (^) like this:
=SUM((range1^2)+(range2^2))
With the example as shown, the formula below will return the same result as SUMX2PY2:
=SUM((B5:B12^2)+(C5:C12^2)) // returns 600
Notes
Arguments can be a mix of constants, names, arrays, or references that contain numbers.
Empty cells are ignored, but cells with zero values are included.
SUMX2PY2 returns #N/A if the arrays contain different numbers of cells.
If a cell in array_x or array_y is empty, or contains text, the pair of values are ignored.
