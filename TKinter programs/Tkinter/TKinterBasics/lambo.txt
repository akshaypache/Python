Ferruccio Lamborghini, an Italian manufacturing magnate, founded
Automobili Ferruccio Lamborghini S.p.A. in 1963 to compete
with established marques, including Ferrari. The company was
noted for using a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive.
Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first decade, but sales
plunged in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn
and the oil crisis. The firm's ownership changed three times
after 1973, including a bankruptcy in 1978. American Chrysler
Corporation took control of Lamborghini in 1987 and sold it to
Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group
V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power
sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed
under the control of the group's Audi division.
