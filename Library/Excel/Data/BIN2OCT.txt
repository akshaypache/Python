Purpose 

Converts a binary number to octal



Return value 

Octal number



Arguments 

number - The binary number you want to convert to octal.places - [optional] If omitted uses the least number of characters required to represent the number, otherwise pads the result with zeros up to the specified number of places.



Syntax 

=BIN2OCT(number, [places])



Usage notes 


The input number must contain only zeros and ones and be less than 10 characters long, otherwise the function returns the #NUM! error value.
