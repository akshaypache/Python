Summary
The Excel YEAR function returns the year component of a date as a 4-digit number. You can use the YEAR function to extract a year number from a date into a cell or to extract and feed a year value into another formula, like the DATE function.
Purpose 
Get the year from a date
Return value 
Year as 4-digit number
Arguments 
date - A valid Excel date.
Syntax 
=YEAR(date)
Usage notes 
The YEAR function extracts the year from a given date as a 4-digit number. For example:
=YEAR("23-Aug-2012") // returns 2012
=YEAR("11-May-2019") // returns 2019
You can use the YEAR function to extract a month number from a date into a cell, or to feed a month number into another function like the DATE function:
=DATE(YEAR(A1),1,1) // first of same year
See below for more examples of formulas that use the DATE function.
Note: dates are serial numbers in Excel, and begin on January 1, 1900. Dates before 1900 are not supported. To display date values in a human-readable date format, apply the number format of your choice.
Notes
Date must be a valid Excel date.
YEAR will return a #VALUE error on text values.
