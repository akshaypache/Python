Summary
The Excel ODD function returns the next odd integer after rounding a given number up. The ODD function always rounds numbers away from zero, so positive numbers become larger and negative numbers become smaller (i.e. more negative).
Purpose 
Round a number up to the next odd integer
Return value 
A rounded number.
Arguments 
number - The number to round up to an odd integer.
Syntax 
=ODD(number)
Usage notes 
The ODD function rounds numbers up to the next odd integer. ODD always rounds numbers away from zero, so positive numbers become larger and negative numbers become smaller (i.e. more negative).
ODD takes just one argument, number, which should be a numeric value. With positive numbers, ODD rounds number up to the next odd integer. With negative values, ODD rounds number down away from zero to the next odd negative integer. With one (1) and numbers that are already odd integers, number is unchanged.
Examples
The ODD function rounds positive numbers up to the next odd integer:
=ODD(2) // returns 3
=ODD(5.1) // returns 7
Negative numbers are rounded away from zero to the next odd integer:
=ODD(-2) // returns -3
=ODD(-5.1) // returns -7
The number 1 and numbers that are already odd integers are unaffected:
=ODD(3) // returns 3
=ODD(1) // returns 1
=ODD(-3) // returns -3
To round numbers up to the next even integer, see the EVEN function.
