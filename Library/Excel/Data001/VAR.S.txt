Summary
The Excel VAR.S function returns the variance of a sample. If data represents the entire population, use the VAR.P function. VAR.S ignores text values and logicals in references.
Purpose 
Get variation of a sample
Return value 
Computed variance
Arguments 
number1 - First number or reference.number2 - [optional] Second number or reference.
Syntax 
=VAR.S(number1, [number2], ...)
Usage notes 
The VAR.S function calculates the variance of a sample of data. Variance provides a general idea of the spread of data.  The VAR.S function can accept up to 254 arguments.
Note while VAR.S ignores text and logicals passed into as cell references, it will evaluate logical values, and text representations of numbers hardcoded directly as arguments. In other words, VAR.S will ignore FALSE when it appears in a range like A1:A10, but will evaluate FALSE when it is provided as an argument.

VAR.S only evaluates numbers in references, ignoring empty cells, text, and logical values like TRUE or FALSE.
Arguments can either be numbers or names, arrays, or references that contain numbers.
Arguments can be hard-coded values instead of references.
To evaluate logical values and/or text in references, use the VARA function.
