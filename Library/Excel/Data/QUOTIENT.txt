Summary






The Excel QUOTIENT function returns the integer portion of division without the remainder. Use QUOTIENT to discard the remainder after division.


















Purpose 

Returns the quotient without a remainder.



Return value 

Integer Number



Arguments 

numerator - The number to be divided.denominator - The number to divide by.



Syntax 

=QUOTIENT(numerator, denominator)



Usage notes 

The QUOTIENT function returns the integer portion of division without the remainder. You can use QUOTIENT to discard the remainder after division. To perform division with a remainder, use the division operator "/". To return only the remainder, use the MOD function.
QUOTIENT function takes two arguments, numerator and denominator. Numerator is the number that should be divided, and denominator is the number to divide numerator by.
Examples
The number 5 divided by 2 returns 2.5, since 2 goes into 5 two and a half times:

=5/2 // returns 2.5

With the QUOTIENT function, the decimal portion is discarded:

=QUOTIENT(5,2) // returns 2

Other examples:

=QUOTIENT(3,5) // returns 0
=QUOTIENT(25,5) // returns 5
=QUOTIENT(10,3) // returns 3

Notes

If denominator is zero (0) or a reference to an empty cell, QUOTIENT returns #DIV!
To return only the remainder, use the MOD function.
