Summary
The Excel CHOOSECOLS function returns specific columns from an array or range. The columns to return are provided as numbers in separate arguments. Each number corresponds to the numeric index of a column in the given array.
Purpose 
Return specific columns from an array
Return value 
Extracted columns in a single array
Arguments 
array - The array to extract columns from.col_num1 - The numeric index of the first column to return.col_num2 - [optional] The numeric index of the second column to return.
Syntax 
=CHOOSECOLS(array, col_num1, [col_num2], ...)
Usage notes 
The Excel CHOOSECOLS function returns specific columns from an array or range. The columns to return are provided as numbers in separate arguments. Each number corresponds to the numeric index of a column in the source array. The result from CHOOSECOLS is always a single array that spills onto the worksheet.
The first argument in the CHOOSECOLS function is array. Array can be a range, or an array from another formula. Additional arguments are in the form col_num1, col_num2, col_num3, etc. Each number represents a specific column to extract from the array, and should be supplied as a whole number.
Basic usage
To get columns 1 and 3 from an array, you can use CHOOSECOLS like this:
=CHOOSECOLS(A1:C5,1,3) // columns 1 and 3
To get the same two columns in reverse order:
=CHOOSECOLS(A1:C5,3,1) // columns 3 and 1
CHOOSECOLS will return a #VALUE! error if a requested column number is out of range:
=CHOOSECOLS(A1:C5,4) // returns #VALUE!
With array constants
Another option for specifying which columns to return is to use an array constant like {1,2,3} as the second argument (col_num1). In the example below, the formula in H3 is:
=CHOOSECOLS(B3:F9,{1,3,5})
With the array constant {1,3,5} given as the second argument, CHOOSECOLS returns columns 1, 3, and 5:
The array constant provided can be in the form {1,2,3} or {1;2;3}.
With arrays
As seen above, you can use an array constant as the second argument in CHOOSECOLS to indicate columns. You can also use an array created with a formula. For example, the formula below uses CHOOSECOLS and the SEQUENCE function to reverse the order of columns in an array:
=CHOOSECOLS(array,SEQUENCE(COLUMNS(array),,COLUMNS(array),-1))
When given a 3-column range or array, SEQUENCE returns {3;2;1} to CHOOSECOLS, and CHOOSECOLS returns the 3 columns in reverse order:
The formula returns all the columns in Array, starting with the last column.
Notes
CHOOSECOLS will return a #VALUE error if a column number is out of range.
