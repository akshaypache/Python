Summary






The Excel TRUNC function returns a truncated number based on an (optional) number of digits. For example, TRUNC(4.9) will return 4, and TRUNC(-3.5) will return -3. The TRUNC function does no rounding, it simply truncates as specified.


















Purpose 

Truncate a number to a given precision



Return value 

A truncated number



Arguments 

number - The number to truncate.num_digits - [optional] The precision of the truncation (default is 0).



Syntax 

=TRUNC(number, [num_digits])



Usage notes 

The TRUNC function returns a truncated number based on an (optional) number of digits. For example, TRUNC(4.9) will return 4, and TRUNC(-3.5) will return -3. The TRUNC function does no rounding, it simply truncates as specified.
The TRUNC function takes two arguments: number and num_digits. Number is the numeric value to truncate. The num_digits argument is optional and specifies the place at which number should be truncated. Num_digits defaults to zero (0).
Examples
By default, TRUNC will return the integer portion of a number:

=TRUNC(4.9) // returns 4
=TRUNC(-3.5) // returns -3

To control the place at which number is truncated, provide a value for num_digits. 

=TRUNC(3.141593) // returns 3
=TRUNC(3.141593,0) // returns 3
=TRUNC(3.141593,1) // returns 3.1
=TRUNC(3.141593,2) // returns 3.14
=TRUNC(3.141593,3) // returns 3.141

When num_digits is negative, the TRUNC function will replace the number at a given place with zero:

=TRUNC(999.99,0) // returns 999
=TRUNC(999.99,-1) // returns 990
=TRUNC(999.99,-2) // returns 900

TRUNC vs. INT
The TRUNC function is similar to the INT function because they both can return the integer part of a number. However, TRUNC simply truncates a number, while INT actually rounds a number down to an integer. With positive numbers, and when TRUNC is using the default of 0 for num_digits, both functions return the same results. With negative numbers, the results can be different. INT(-3.1) returns -4, because INT rounds down to the lower integer. TRUNC(-3.1) returns -3. If you simply want the integer part of a number, you should use TRUNC.
Rounding functions in Excel
Excel provides a number of functions for rounding:

To round normally, use the ROUND function.
To round to the nearest multiple, use the MROUND function.
To round down to the nearest specified place, use the ROUNDDOWN function.
To round down to the nearest specified multiple, use the FLOOR function.
To round up to the nearest specified place, use the ROUNDUP function.
To round up to the nearest specified multiple, use the CEILING function.
To round down and return an integer only, use the INT function.
To truncate decimal places, use the TRUNC function.
