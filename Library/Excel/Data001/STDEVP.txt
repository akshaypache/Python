STDEVP Function
Related functions 
STDEV
STDEV.S
STDEV.P
Summary
The STDEVP function calculates the standard deviation for data that represents a population. STDEVP has been replaced with a newer function called STDEV.P, which has the same behavior.
Purpose 
Get standard deviation of population
Return value 
Estimated standard deviation
Arguments 
number1 - First number or reference in the sample.number2 - [optional] Second number or reference.
Syntax 
=STDEVP(number1, [number2], ...)
Usage notes 
The STDEVP function calculates the standard deviation for an entire population. Standard deviation is a measure of how much variance there is in a set of numbers compared to the average (mean) of the numbers. The STDEVP function is meant to estimate standard deviation for an entire population. If data represents a sample, use the STDEV function.
Note: STDEVP has been replaced with a newer function called STDEV.P, which has identical behavior. Although STDEVP still exists for backwards compatibility, Microsoft recommends that people use the newer STDEV.P function instead.

Notes:
STDEVP calculates standard deviation using the "n" method, ignoring logical values and text.
STDEVP assumes your data is the entire population. When your data is a sample set only, calculate standard deviation using the STDEV function (or its more current replacement, the STDEV.S function).
Numbers are supplied as arguments. They can be supplied as actual numbers, ranges, arrays, or references that contain numbers.
The STDEVP function ignores logical values and text. If you want to include logical values and/or numbers as text in a reference, use the STDEVA function.
