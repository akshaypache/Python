STDEV.P Function
Related functions 

STDEVP
STDEV
STDEV.S























Summary






The Excel STDEV.P function calculates the standard deviation for a sample set of data. STDEV.P calculates standard deviation using the "n" method, ignoring logical values and text.


















Purpose 

Get standard deviation of population



Return value 

Estimated standard deviation



Arguments 

number1 - First number or reference in the sample.number2 - [optional] Second number or reference.



Syntax 

=STDEV.P(number1, [number2], ...)



Usage notes 

The STDEV.P function calculates the standard deviation for a sample set of data. Standard deviation is a measure of how much variance there is in a set of numbers compared to the average (mean) of the numbers. The STDEV.P function is meant to estimate standard deviation for an entire population. If data represents a sample, use the STDEV.S function.
Note: STDEV.P replaces the STDEVP function, with identical behavior. Although STDEVP still exists for backwards compatibility, Microsoft recommends that people use the newer STDEV.P function instead.

Notes:

STDEV.P calculates standard deviation using the "n" method, ignoring logical values and text.
STDEV.P assumes data is an entire population. When data is a sample only, use the STDEV.S function.
Numbers are supplied as arguments. They can be supplied as actual numbers, ranges, arrays, or references that contain numbers.
To evaluate logical values and/or numbers as text in a reference, use the STDEVA function.
