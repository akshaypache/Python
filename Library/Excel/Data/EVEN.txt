Summary






The Excel EVEN function rounds numbers up to the next even integer. The EVEN function always rounds numbers away from zero, so positive numbers become larger and negative numbers become smaller (i.e. more negative).


















Purpose 

Round a number up to the next even integer



Return value 

An even integer.



Arguments 

number - The number to round up to an even integer.



Syntax 

=EVEN(number)



Usage notes 

The EVEN function rounds numbers up to the next even integer. EVEN always rounds numbers away from zero, so positive numbers become larger and negative numbers become smaller (i.e. more negative).
EVEN takes just one argument, number, which should be a numeric value. With positive numbers, EVEN rounds number up to the next even integer. With negative values, EVEN rounds number down away from zero to the next negative integer. With zero (0) and numbers that are already even integers, number is unchanged.
Examples
The EVEN function rounds positive numbers up to the next even integer:

=EVEN(1) // returns 2
=EVEN(3.1) // returns 4

Negative numbers are rounded away from zero to the next even integer:

=EVEN(-1) // returns -2
=EVEN(-3.1) // returns -4

Zero and numbers that are already even integers are unaffected:

=EVEN(2) // returns 2
=EVEN(0) // returns 0
=EVEN(-2) // returns -2

To round numbers up to the next odd integer, see the ODD function.
