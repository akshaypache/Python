Summary
The Excel WEEKDAY function takes a date and returns a number between 1-7 representing the day of week. By default, WEEKDAY returns 1 for Sunday and 7 for Saturday, but this is configurable. You can use the WEEKDAY function inside other formulas to check the day of week.
Purpose 
Get the day of the week as a number
Return value 
A number between 0 and 7.
Arguments 
serial_number - The date for which you want to get the day of week.return_type - [optional] A number representing day of week mapping scheme. Default is 1.
Syntax 
=WEEKDAY(serial_number, [return_type])
Usage notes 
The WEEKDAY function takes a date and returns a number between 1-7 representing the day of the week. The WEEKDAY function takes two arguments: serial_number and return_type. Serial_number should be a valid Excel date in serial number format. Return_type is an optional numeric code that controls which day of the week is considered the first day. By default, WEEKDAY returns 1 for Sunday and 7 for Saturday, as seen in the table below:

WEEKDAY supports several numbering schemes, controlled by the return_type argument. Return_type is optional and defaults to 1. The table below shows available return_type codes, the numeric result of each code, and which day is the first day in the mapping scheme.

Note: the WEEKDAY function will return a value even when the date is empty. Take care to trap this result if blank dates are possible.
Examples
By default and without a value fore return_type, WEEKDAY starts counting on Sunday:
=WEEKDAY("3-Jan-21") // Sunday, returns 1
=WEEKDAY("4-Jan-21") // Monday, returns 2
To configure WEEKDAY to start on Monday, set return_type to 2:
=WEEKDAY("3-Jan-21",2) // Sunday, returns 7
=WEEKDAY("4-Jan-21",2) // Monday, returns 1
In the example shown above, the formula in D5 (copied down) is:
=WEEKDAY(B5) // Sunday start
The formula in E5 (copied down) is:
=WEEKDAY(B5,2) // Monday start
Notes
By default, WEEKDAY returns 1 for Sunday and 7 for Saturday.
WEEKDAY returns a value (7) even if the date is empty.
