Summary
The Excel YIELD function returns the yield on a security that pays periodic interest.
Purpose 
Get yield for security that pays periodic interest
Return value 
Yield as percentage
Arguments 
sd - Settlement date of the security.md - Maturity date of the security.rate - Annual coupon rate.pr - Security's price per $100 face value.redemption - Redemption value per $100 face value.frequency - Coupon payments per year (annual = 1, semiannual = 2; quarterly = 4).basis - [optional] Day count basis (see below, default =0).
Syntax 
=YIELD(sd, md, rate, pr, redemption, frequency, [basis])
Usage notes 
The YIELD function returns the yield on a security that pays periodic interest. In the example shown, the formula in F6 is:
=YIELD(C9,C10,C7,F5,C6,C12,C13)
with these inputs, the YIELD function returns 0.08 which, or 8.00% when formatted with the percentage number format.
Entering dates
In Excel, dates are serial numbers. Generally, the best way to enter valid dates is to use cell references, as shown in the example. If you want to enter valid dates directly inside a function, the DATE function is the best approach.
Basis
The basis argument controls how days are counted. The PRICE function allows 5 options (0-4) and defaults to zero, which specifies US 30/360 basis. This article on Wikipedia provides a detailed explanation of available conventions.
