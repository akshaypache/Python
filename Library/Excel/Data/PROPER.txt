Summary






The Excel PROPER function capitalizes each word in a given text string. Numbers, punctuation, and spaces are not affected.


















Purpose 

Capitalize the first letter in each word



Return value 

Text in proper case.



Arguments 

text - The text that should be converted to proper case.



Syntax 

=PROPER(text)



Usage notes 

The PROPER function capitalizes each word in a given text string. PROPER function takes just one argument, text, which can be a text value or cell reference. PROPER first lowercases any uppercase letters, then capitalizes each word in the provided text string. Numbers, punctuation, and spaces are not affected. PROPER will convert numbers to text with number formatting removed.
Examples

=PROPER("apple") // returns "Apple"
=PROPER("APPLE") // returns "Apple"

Numbers or punctuation characters inside a text string are unaffected:

=PROPER("XYY-020-kwp") // returns "Xyy-020-Kwp"

If a numeric value is given to PROPER, number formatting is removed. For example, if cell A1 contains the date June 26, 2021, date formatting will be lost and PROPER will return a date serial number as text:

=PROPER(A1) // returns "44373"


Related functions

Notes

Use PROPER to capitalize each word in a given string.
All words in a text string are capitalized.
Numbers and punctuation characters are not affected.
