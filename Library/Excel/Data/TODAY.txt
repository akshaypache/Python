Summary






The Excel TODAY function returns the current date, updated continuously when a worksheet is changed or opened. The TODAY function takes no arguments. You can format the value returned by TODAY with a date number format. If you need current date and time, use the NOW function.


















Purpose 

Get the current date



Return value 

Excel date as a serial number



Arguments 





Syntax 

=TODAY()



Usage notes 

The TODAY function returns the current date, and will continually update each time the worksheet is updated. Use F9 to force the worksheet to recalculate and update the value.
The value returned by the TODAY function is a standard Excel date. To display the result as a date, apply a date number format. Optionally customize the number format as you like. If you want the current date with a time value, use the NOW function.
Examples
The TODAY function can be used on its own, or combined with other functions. The formulas below show how the TODAY function can be used in various ways:

=TODAY()  // current date
=TODAY()-7  // one week in past
=TODAY()+7  // one week in future
=TODAY()+90  // 90 days from today
=EDATE(TODAY(),3)  // 3 months from today
=EDATE(TODAY(),12)  // 1 year from today
=EDATE(TODAY(),-12)  // 1 year in the past
=EOMONTH(TODAY(),-1)+1  // first day of current month
=TODAY()+TIME(18,0,0)  // today at 6:00 PM
=TODAY()+1+TIME(12,0,0)  // tomorrow at noon

Static date and time
If you need a static date and time that won't change,  you can use the following shortcuts:

Insert current date - Control + ;
Insert current time - Control + Shift + :

To enter both values in a single cell, enter the date, a space, then the time.
Formatting results
The result of TODAY is a serial number representing a valid Excel date. You can format the value returned by TODAY using any standard date format. You can use the TEXT function to build a text message that includes the current date:

="The current date is "&TEXT(TODAY(),"mmm d")

To return a message like "The current date is May 31".
