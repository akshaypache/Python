DEGREES Function

RADIANS
PI
Summary
The Excel DEGREES function converts angles (expressed in radians) to degrees. For example, the formula =DEGREES(PI()) returns 180.
Purpose 
Converts radians to degrees
Return value 
Degrees
Arguments 
angle - Angle in radians that you want to convert to degrees.
Syntax 
=DEGREES(angle)
Usage notes 
The DEGREES function takes an angle in radians and converts it to degrees. Radians measure angles using the radius of a circle, as illustrated in this image:
To convert degrees back to radians, you can use the RADIANS function.
Converting degrees to radians manually
Because Pi = 180°, the general formula for degrees to radians is degrees * PI()/180. For example, to convert 45° to radians, the Excel formula would be 45*PI( )/180 which equals 0.7854 radians. More examples in the table below:

=45*PI()/180

=30*PI()/180
30
=20*PI()/180
