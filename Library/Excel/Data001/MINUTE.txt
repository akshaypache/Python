Summary
The Excel MINUTE function extracts the minute component of a time as a number between 0-59. For example, with a time of 9:45 AM, minute will return 45. You can use the MINUTE function to extract the minute into a cell, or feed the result into another function like the TIME function.
Purpose 
Get minute as a number (0-59) from time
Return value 
Number between 0 and 59.
Arguments 
serial_number - A valid date or time.
Syntax 
=MINUTE(serial_number)
Usage notes 
The MINUTE function extracts the minute from a time as a number between 0-59. For example, given a time of "7:45", MINUTE will return 45. The MINUTE function takes just one argument, serial_number, which must be a valid Excel date or a valid Excel time.
Times can be supplied to the MINUTE function as text (e.g. "7:45 PM") or as decimal numbers (e.g. 0.5, which equals 12:00 PM). To create a time value from scratch with separate hour, minute, and second inputs, use the TIME function.
The MINUTE function will "reset" to 0 every 60 minutes (like a clock). To work with minute values larger than 60, use a formula to convert time to decimal minutes.
Examples
To use the MINUTE function, supply a time value:
=MINUTE("9:45 AM") // returns 45
=MINUTE("3:10 PM") // returns 10
You can use the MINUTE function to extract the minute into a cell, or feed the result into another function like the TIME function. For example, with the time 5:45 PM in cell A1, you can create a new time that includes 45 minutes like this:
=TIME(7,MINUTE(A1),0) // returns 7:45 PM
Times can be supplied as text (e.g. "7:45 PM") or as decimal numbers (e.g. 0.5, which equals 12:00 PM). In general, it's best to use the TIME function to create time values, because it reduces errors.
Note: Excel stores dates and times as serial numbers. For example, the date Jan 1, 2000 12:00 PM is equal to the serial number 32526.5 in Excel. To check that Excel is correctly recognizing a date or time, you can temporarily format the date as a number.
Notes
MINUTE will return the #VALUE error if Excel interprets the given date or time as text.
Minute values will "rollover" after 60 minutes. You can use a formula to convert time values to decimal minutes.
