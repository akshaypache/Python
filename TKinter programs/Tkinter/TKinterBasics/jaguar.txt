Jaguar's business was founded as the Swallow Sidecar Company in
1922, originally making motorcycle sidecars before developing
bodies for passenger cars. Under the ownership of S. S. Cars
Limited the business extended to complete cars made in
association with Standard Motor Co, many bearing Jaguar as a
model name. The company's name was changed from S. S. Cars to
Jaguar Cars in 1945. A merger with the British Motor Corporation
followed in 1966,[3] the resulting enlarged company now being
renamed as British Motor Holdings (BMH), which in 1968 merged
with Leyland Motor Corporation and became British Leyland, itself
 to be nationalised in 1975.
