Summary






The Excel VARA function estimates the variance of a sample of data. Unlike the VAR function, the VARA function evaluates text values and logicals in references.


















Purpose 

Get variation of a sample



Return value 

Computed variance



Arguments 

number1 - First number or reference.number2 - [optional] Second number or reference.



Syntax 

=VARA(number1, [number2], ...)



Usage notes 

The VAR function estimates the variance for a sample of data. Variance provides a general idea of the spread of data. Unlike the VAR function, the VARA function evaluates text values and logicals in references. Text is evaluated as zero, TRUE is evaluated as 1, and FALSE is evaluated as zero. 
In the example shown, the formula in F5 is:

=VARA(C5:C10)

Note that the VAR function ignores the "NA" text in C8, while VARA includes this in the variance estimate as zero.
Like VAR, VARA also evaluates logical values, and text representations of numbers when they are hardcoded directly into the function as arguments.

VARP

VAR.S

VAR.P

VARA

Notes

VARA assumes arguments a sample of data, not entire population. If data represents the entire population, use VARPA or VAR.P
VARA evaluates text values and logicals in references, unlike VAR.
Arguments can either be numbers or names, arrays, or references that contain numbers.
Arguments can be hard-coded values instead of references.
To ignore logical values and/or text in references, use VAR or VAR.S.
