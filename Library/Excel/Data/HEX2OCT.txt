Summary






The Excel HEX2OCT function converts a hexadecimal number to its octal equivalent.

















Purpose 

Converts a hexadecimal number to octal



Return value 

Octal number



Arguments 

number - The hexadecimal number you want to convert to octal.places - [optional] Pads the resulting binary number with zeros up to the specified number of digits. If omitted returns the least number of characters required to represent the number.



Syntax 

=HEX2OCT(number, [places])



Usage notes 


Excel only converts to octal numbers of 10-digits or less, restricting the range of valid input to [0, 7777777777] (octal).
The input number must be less than or equal to ten alpha-numeric characters, otherwise the function returns the #NUM! error value.

Negative Numbers
Excel interprets both octal and hexadecimal numbers using two's complement notation. Two's complement notation is a convention that computers use to represent negative numbers in binary.
