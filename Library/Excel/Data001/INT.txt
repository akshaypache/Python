Summary
The Excel INT function returns the integer part of a decimal number by rounding down to the integer. Note that negative numbers become more negative. For example, while INT(10.8) returns 10, INT(-10.8) returns -11.
Purpose 
Get the integer part of a number by rounding down
Return value 
The integer part of the number after rounding down
Arguments 
number - The number from which you want an integer.
Syntax 
=INT(number)
Usage notes 
The INT function returns the integer part of a decimal number by rounding down to the integer. It is important to understand that the INT function returns the integer part of a decimal number, after rounding down. One consequence of this behavior is that negative numbers become more negative. For example, while INT(10.8) returns 10, INT(-10.8) returns -11. To return an integer by truncating decimals, see the TRUNC function.
The INT function takes just one argument, number, which should be a numeric value. INT returns a #VALUE! error if number is not a numeric value. If number is already a whole number, INT has no effect.
Examples
When numbers are positive, the INT function rounds down to the next lowest whole number:
=INT(3.25) // returns 3
=INT(3.99) // returns 3
=INT(3.01) // returns 3
Notice INT rounds positive numbers down toward zero. With negative numbers, INT rounds down away from zero:
=INT(-3.25) // returns -4
=INT(-3.99) // returns -4
=INT(-3.01) // returns -4
INT vs. TRUNC
INT is similar to the TRUNC function because they both can return the integer part of a number. However, TRUNC simply truncates a number, while INT actually rounds a number down to an integer. With positive numbers, and when TRUNC is using the default of 0 for num_digits,  both functions return the same results. With negative numbers, the results can be different. INT(-3.1) returns -4, because INT rounds down to the lower integer. TRUNC(-3.1) returns -3. If you simply want the integer part of a number, you should use TRUNC.
Rounding functions in Excel
Excel provides a number of functions for rounding:
To round normally, use the ROUND function.
To round to the nearest multiple, use the MROUND function.
To round down to the nearest specified place, use the ROUNDDOWN function.
To round down to the nearest specified multiple, use the FLOOR function.
To round up to the nearest specified place, use the ROUNDUP function.
To round up to the nearest specified multiple, use the CEILING function.
To round down and return an integer only, use the INT function.
To truncate decimal places, use the TRUNC function.
Notes
INT returns a #VALUE! error if number is not a numeric value.
Use the INT function to get an integer from a number by rounding.
Use the TRUNC function to return an integer by truncating.
